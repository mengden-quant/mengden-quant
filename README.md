# Alexey Mengden — Transitioning to FO Quant / Desk Strat (Sell-Side)

Python/C++ · Derivatives (SDE/Monte Carlo)

Current: Model Risk / IRB (credit & regulatory models).
Target: Front-Office Quant / Desk Strat — pricing, Greeks, calibration, hedging intuition, desk tooling.

## Current focus
- Monte Carlo pricing: variance reduction, stable estimators, Greeks checks
- Vol & calibration: vanilla surface building + robustness/stability diagnostics
- Quant engineering: clean interfaces, tests, reproducibility, CI

## Public work (in progress)
- `validation-series-quant/` — supporting code for my LinkedIn posts (background)
- (WIP) Barrier option pricing (MC) + variance reduction + Greeks checks + benchmarks

## Engineering standards
- Reproducible runs (pinned deps), unit/regression tests, sanity checks
- Benchmarks: accuracy vs runtime trade-offs documented in README
- CI on push/PR
